        <h1>Dale Chihuly</h1>

        <p>Dale Chihuly, (born September 20, 1941, Tacoma, Washington), American artist whose glass sculptures—often presented in complex and dynamic public projects—led to a resurgence of interest in that medium. Chihuly studied interior design at the University of Washington in Seattle (B.A., 1965) and received an M.S. in sculpture from the University of Wisconsin, where he studied glassblowing under Harvey Littleton. In 1968 he received an M.F.A. in ceramics from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). That same year he traveled to Italy on a Fulbright scholarship and a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant and worked at Venini Fabrica, the renowned glassblowing workshop in Murano, an island in the Venice Lagoon. Returning to the United States in 1969, he established the RISD glassblowing program and founded (1971) the influential Pilchuck Glass School north of Seattle. There he created the first of a number of environmental installations—a group of clear glass bulbs floating on Pilchuck Pond. He continued to teach at RISD until 1980.

      <p>In 1976 an automobile accident left Chihuly blind in one eye, and thereafter he was dependent on assistant gaffers (glassblowers) to execute his distinctive designs. Chihuly’s works in glass both echo and extend glass’s historical relationship with functionality. Vase, basket, bowl, and other vessel forms dominated many of his individual pieces, though enlivened with rhythmic tempos and curvaceous motifs far removed from domestic use. Chihuly’s vibrantly coloured organic glass creations were immediately recognizable. His technical innovations enabled the production of a tremendous range of patterns, colours, and textures.
